Can an adopted child live with his caregivers instead of the adoptive parents?,"Once an Adoption Order is granted by the Family Court, the adoptive parents are responsible for all matters in relation to the custody, maintenance and education of the adopted child. This includes the living arrangements of the adopted child."
What is the process of adopting a child from the People’s Republic of China?,"If you wish to adopt a child from the People’s Republic of China or PRC, you are required to comply with the requirements set out by the PRC, in addition to the requirements of Singapore. 

The adoption process will be longer as approval from the PRC authorities must be obtained, and the adoption must be legalised in China before the child can be brought into Singapore to legalise the adoption here. Your presence is required in the PRC to legalise the adoption in China. 

Applications to adopt a child from PRC must be made through agencies accredited by MSF and the Ministry of Civil Affairs of PRC. The agencies accredited by MSF are TOUCH Family Services Ltd and Fei Yue Community Services. 

Please visit the Adoption portal for the full procedure to adopt a child from the PRC."
Do you have adopt a child scheme?,"We do not have an adopt-a-child scheme. But if you would like to foster a child, please visit this page for information."
Can a child be adopted without the consent of his biological parents and caregivers?,"You must obtain the notarised consent from both of the child’s biological parents before applying to adopt the child. If you are unable to obtain the parental consent for various reasons, in your application to the Court, the other birth parent will need to put up an affidavit to explain the reasons for the Court’s consideration to dispense parental consent."
How can I get a refund of the security deposit for Dependant’s Pass?,"If the Adoption Order is granted, you must submit a copy of the child’s new Singapore Birth Certificate to MSF to receive the refund of the security deposit for the Dependent’s Pass. 

If the Court dismisses your application, you are required to return the Dependant’s Pass to MSF for cancellation. 

You will receive the refund 3 months after submission of the child’s new Singapore Birth Certificate or the Dependant’s Pass."
What are the legal implications when I adopt a child?,"Adoption is a legal process governed under the Adoption of Children Act (ACA), Chapter 4. The Family Court of Singapore is the authority that decides on adoption applications. 

When an adoption order is passed by the court, the child’s legal ties with the biological parents will be severed, and the adoptive parents will assume all rights, obligations and responsibilities in the care and education of the child."
Are adoption agencies allowed to charge prospective adopters a fee during the adoption process?,"There may be administrative costs payable to the adoption agency for child placement service. You may refer to the itemised breakdown of agencies’ services on the Adoption Portal.

It is the responsibility of the adoptive parents to ensure that the child was not trafficked or illegally brought into Singapore for the purpose of the adoption."
I am working in Singapore and want to get a Dependant’s Pass for my child to stay with me. How do I apply?,"The Dependant's Pass issued by MSF is for the purpose of adoption only. 

If you wish to apply for a Dependant’s Pass for other purposes, please visit the Ministry of Manpower’s website for full details."
