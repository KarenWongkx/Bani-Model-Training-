What advice does MOH generally have for permitted enterprise workers who have to move around the island a lot?,"Reduce mixing with others wherever possible, and proceed directly from point to point without stopping or dawdling. Workers who are operating outside their home are required to wear a mask at all times."
What is SafeEntry? ,"SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FINs and contact information of individuals visiting workplaces of permitted enterprises, as well as selected public venues for contact tracing purposes.

"How long will Phase Two (Heightened Alert) last for? After this Heightened Alert period ends, will we return to Phase Three?","The Phase Two (Heightened Alert) period will last from 16 May to 13 June 2021 (both dates inclusive). If the local COVID situation stabilises and we are able to deploy our enablers (e.g. safe management measures, contact tracing, testing, vaccinations) to allow more activities to resume safely, we may be able to east some of the current measures. However, if the local COVID situation deteriorates and the need for further tightening of measures is required, they would be calibrated accordingly."
Why are we not implementing another Circuit Breaker?,"We are anxious to bring the infection under control so that we can all go back to some sort of a normal life. But we are far from the conditions before Circuit Breaker last year. Compared with last year, unlinked cases are not many, we have high testing capacity, 30% of population has been fully vaccinated, and we have Trace Together. We are mindful the Phase 2 heightened measures have impacted many businesses, and the Government is committed to supporting them through this difficult time. Circuit Breaker is not a decision we should take lightly. We believe these latest sets of measures are already very stringent and will be able to arrest the latest spike in cases and bring the infection under control. As mentioned by the MTF Co-chairs earlier, we will review the situation in two weeks and introduce more or dial back the measures accordingly. If conditions require it, we will not hesitate to take decisive actions."
What is a Community Care Facility (CCF)?,The majority of persons with COVID-19 infection have only mild to no symptoms and do not require acute hospital care. Such patients are admitted to a Community Care Facility where most recover with minimal intervention. Patients in these facilities are monitored closely in case they need to be transferred to hospital for better management and support.
"Can organisations collect, use and disclose personal data (including NRIC/FIN/passport numbers) of visitors to premises for the purposes of contact tracing and other response measures in the event of a COVID-19 case?","Organisations may collect personal data of visitors to premises for purposes of contact tracing and other response measures in the event of an emergency, such as during the outbreak of the COVID-19. In the event of a COVID-19 case, data can be collected, used and disclosed without consent to carry out contact tracing and other response measures, pursuant to sections 1(b) of the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), as this is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of other individuals. As organisations may require NRIC/FIN/passport numbers to accurately identify individuals in the event of a COVID-19 case, organisations may collect visitors‚Äô NRIC, FIN or passport numbers where it is necessary for this purpose. Organisations that collect such personal data must comply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA, such as making reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in their possession from unauthorised access or disclosure (e.g. Ensure visitor logbooks are kept secured and not visible to other visitors), and ensuring that the personal data is not used for other purposes without consent or authorisation under the law. Organisations should also expunge the data when it is no longer needed for contact tracing-related purposes. Please click here for more FAQs on PDPA."
